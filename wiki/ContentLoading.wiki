= Content Loading =

== Introduction ==
To accomplish with the loading of different resources we introduce 2 new protocols.
{{{
applink:/ --> links between local documents
appfile:/ --> reference to images/scripts/css etc
}}}


== StageWebViewBrige.loadLocalURL ==

Lets us load content from the applicationDirectory.

The benefits of use this method other than loadURL method is that you can refer resources like:
{{{
appfile:/image.png
}}} 

Otherwise you must provide a full resource path like:

{{{
file:///Users/xperiments/Documents/TestAndroidIOS/bin-debug/image.png
}}}

It also injects the necesary code to establish communication with actionscript.

=== Usage ===
{{{
// load document.html from the application directory
webView.loadLocalURL("applink:/document.html");
// load index.html that is inside the html directory in the application directory
webView.loadLocalURL("applink:/html/index.html");
}}}

=== Linking between pages in html ==
{{{
<a href="applink:/someDir/someFile.html">Link</a>
}}}

=== Referencing images, scripts, etc in html ===
{{{
<img src="appfile:/image.png">
<script src="appfile:/myScript.js"></script>
}}}

== StageWebViewBrige.loadURL ==

This method is the same as in the original class.

*Attention:*
{{{
If you like to use the comunication feature of this class you must include the StageWebViewBridge.js file in your html.
}}}

== StageWebViewBrige.loadString ==

This method acts like the original class, but injects the necessary javascript code for the communication.

*Attention:*
{{{
You must provide a valid html code because the injection finds the <head> tag to inject the script.
}}}
