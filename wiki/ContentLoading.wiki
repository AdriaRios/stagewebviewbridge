= Content Loading =

== Introduction ==
To accomplish with the loading of different resources we introduce 3 new protocols.
{{{
applink:/ --> links between local documents
appfile:/ --> reference to images/scripts/css etc
jsfile:/ --> used in JS to get a file path with StageWebViewBridge.getFilePath('jsfile:/fileinroot.html') 
}}}


== Different load methods ==

=== StageWebViewBrige.loadURL === 

Standard method of loading content
=== StageWebViewBrige.loadLocalURL === 

Lets us load content from our www directory.

The benefits of use this method other than loadURL method is that we can refer resources like:
{{{
appfile:/image.png
}}} 

It also injects the necesary code to establish communication with actionscript.

=== Usage ===
`
// load document.html from www root directory
webView.loadLocalURL("applink:/document.html");
// load index.html that is inside the html directory in www root directory
webView.loadLocalURL("applink:/html/index.html");
`

=== StageWebViewBrige.loadString === 

Same as the standard loadString method, but also injects the necesary code to make bidirectional communication between AS3 and JS.

=== StageWebViewBrige.loadLocalString === 

Creates a temporally file in the filesystem with the contents provided.
This lets us reference local files with the diferents protocols provided.

=== Usage ===
{{{

var html:String = '<html><head><head><body><img src="appfile:/image.jpg"></body></html>';
webView.loadLocalString( html );

}}}


=== Linking between pages in html ==
{{{
<a href="applink:/someDir/someFile.html">Link</a>
}}}

=== Referencing images, scripts, etc in html ===
{{{
<img src="appfile:/image.png">
<script src="appfile:/myScript.js"></script>
}}}

== StageWebViewBrige.loadURL ==

This method is the same as in the original class.

*Attention:*
{{{
If you like to use the comunication feature of this class you must 
include the StageWebViewBridge.js file in your html.
}}}

== StageWebViewBrige.loadString ==

This method acts like the original class, but injects the necessary javascript code for the communication.

*Attention:*
{{{
You must provide a valid html code because the injection finds the <head> tag to inject the script.
}}}
