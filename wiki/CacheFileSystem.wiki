== Cache FileSystem ==

Working with localfiles is tedious. You must provide paths in a native path.

To overcome this situation we have provide StageWebViewBridge with new ways of referencing resources.
Now we can reference a file with "appfile:/index.html".



For example, the code:
{{{
<img src="appfile:/images/background.png">
}}}

 



The cache filesystem generates "parsed" versions of your original files.
The system do all the work for you.



Now you can assign the root directory for your content.
{{{
// this will set the base working directory
StageWebViewBridge.setRootFolder('html');
// after that 2 new directories will be created
// homeCache
// homeSource
// this will be the 2 directories you must include in your final package.
}}}
